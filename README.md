## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* __*Machine Learning Model 1*__
  * Balanced Accuracy Score   : 0.94 <br />
  * Healthy Loan Precision    : 1.00 <br />
  * High-risk Loan Precision  : 0.87 <br />
  * Healthy Loan Recall       : 1.00 <br />
  * High-risk Loan Recall     : 0.89 <br />

* __*Machine Learning Model 2*__
  * Balanced Accuracy Score   : 0.99 <br />
  * Healthy Loan Precision    : 1.00 <br />
  * High-risk Loan Precision  : 0.87 <br />
  * Healthy Loan Recall       : 1.00 <br />

## Summary

You can see both models are pretty accurate, but the second is more so - using the resampled data. You can see this with the higher Balanced Accuracy Score and Recall rates.

Performance-wise, it depends on the result we are looking for. The idea is to grade the risk correctly so the source data used for training is vital to get useful information out of the model.
